*DESCRIPTION*:
As part of the internship task, I redesigned an existing landing page to significantly improve its usability and visual appeal. The original version of the page was very simple and lacked a structured layout, proper spacing, and engaging design elements. It contained plain text with limited formatting, no navigation menu, and no visual cues to guide the userâ€™s attention. Overall, it appeared outdated and did not follow modern design principles, which could lead to poor user engagement and a lack of clarity.

To enhance the design, I created a more structured layout by dividing the content into clearly defined sections such as a header, hero area, and main content blocks. I used HTML and CSS to build the redesigned version from scratch, focusing on better readability, consistency, and modern UI aesthetics. The header now includes a basic navigation bar with links like "Home", "About", and "Contact" to provide users with an idea of the site structure. This helps improve navigation and user orientation.

For the main message, I created a hero section that prominently displays the text about the completion certificate and internship information. I used a modern sans-serif font ("Segoe UI") to replace the default system font, ensuring better legibility and a more polished look. The call-to-action button ("Get Started") was given a more visible and engaging design using a blue background, white text, padding, and rounded corners. This button is placed strategically below the key message to prompt user interaction.

I also improved the color scheme by introducing a light blue background that gives the page a calm and professional feel. White containers with box shadows were used to separate content areas and add visual depth. These elements help to avoid a flat appearance and make the content stand out better. Proper spacing, padding, and alignment were applied throughout the layout to ensure visual balance and consistency across all elements.

The redesigned content includes a section with clear headings such as "Instructions" and "Deliverables" so users can easily find important information. Compared to the plain paragraph style used in the original version, this approach increases scannability and helps users digest the content more efficiently.

In addition to the visual and structural improvements, I focused on accessibility and responsiveness. Although the current version is desktop-first, the layout was designed with future responsiveness in mind so it can be adapted for mobile devices using media queries if required.
